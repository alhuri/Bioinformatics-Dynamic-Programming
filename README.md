# Bioinformatics-Dynamic-Programming

A dynamic programming algorithm:

Given three DNA sequences, A, B and C, to find a sequence D that satisfies sum of the editing distance between A and D, the editing distance between B and D and the editing distance between C and D is minimum.

Making three choices of insertion, deletion and substitution, breaking down the problem into Smaller problems with a matrix, where we store the edit distance of all sequences.
